# PantryManager
This is my project for the WiCS Spring 2020 Hackathon

With a simple user interface, a user can keep track of pantry contents, recipes, and a shopping list. Try to follow the input instructions because I didn't include protections for bad user input. The .txt files can be changed directly or through the functions provided in main to run tests.
